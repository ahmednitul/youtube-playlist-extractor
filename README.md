This converts a youtube playlist into a series of urls. I personally used it for get-flash-videos however now it is simple to download a playlist using [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)

It prints out many duplicates, just pipe the output through `sort -u` in order to obtain unique links.

It probably does not extract multiple page urls.
